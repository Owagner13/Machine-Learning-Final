## Notes and Updates

The goal of this project was to implement machine learning methods in Python. Due to this, there were aspects of the project that were overlooked because it was different from the goal of the class. Also, having learned more over the past two years, there are many other issues I have identified. Below is a list of oversights/problems:

1. The assumption, if missing at random, is a large generalization of the data based on little knowledge of the data collection
2. After splitting into test and train, I did not check the distribution of the outcome variable across the subsets
3. There was not enough hyperparameter tuning and pruning of the random forest model
4. Did not explore different accuracy measures that may be a better measure given the problem

I initially decided to delete this project, but the more I thought about it, the more I felt it was an excellent way to show my growth as a data scientist. It was a project I felt very proud of at the time, but I can acknowledge there are many oversights in this project, some intentional and others unintentional. It is essential to be critical of my work and understand the impacts that these oversights may have on my findings.
